# Build Docker Images

Based on `ros:noetic` (ROS 1) and `ros:rolling` (ROS 2), we will build full ROS / ROS 2 docker images and upload those images to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/).
The reason to build full docker images for ROS and ROS 2 is basic container images do not include useful samples or examples packages, which can be very useful for container application on Kubernetes cluster system.
